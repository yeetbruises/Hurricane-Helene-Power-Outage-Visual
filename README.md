Overview - 

This project was developed in Python using various packages like 
Selenium, GeoPandas, and Shapely. I made in one go over 24 hours. 
It started when I came across an interesting data source on USAToday's 
website (Source 2) and built a Selenium scraper to compile the data 
into a CSV file. Using Pandas, I processed the CSV and linked the 
county names to a shapefile of U.S. counties from Source 1. To do 
this, I converted the county names to FIPS IDs, which the shapefile 
used (Source 4). The final output was displayed using Matplotlib, 
resulting in an automated system for data collection and 
visualization.

File Descriptions:

    grabdata.py - This file scrapes data from a USAToday website and 
                  assembles a CSV out of it. 

 displaydata.py - This file takes the csv generated by grabdata.py   
                  and matches each column name (county name) to a    
                  corresponding entry in the US counties shapefile.   
                  A connection between the two is facilitated by     
                  converting names into FIPS codes retrieved from    
                  county-fips.csv. The animation is done by doing    
                  this for each row of the power outage CSV.

    shapefiles/ - A folder of shapefiles used to fetch county data.

        render/ - Output folder of rendered images in matplotlib.

    outagedata/ - CSVs generated by grabdata.py which contain power outage data.
                * "outputnew.csv" is the complete one with all the needed data.

county-fips.csv
 uscounties.csv - Other sources of county data, e.g. FIPS codes, population.
